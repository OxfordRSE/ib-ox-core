    Custom domain name for the application (e.g. "dashboard.example.ac.uk").
    Set this in your terraform.tfvars file. When set:
      - Terraform requests an ACM certificate via DNS validation (Route 53).
      - A Route 53 ALIAS record is created pointing the domain to the ALB.
      - The HTTPS listener (port 443) is created; HTTP redirects to HTTPS.
    Leave empty ("") for HTTP-only with the ALB DNS name directly.

    After the first apply with a domain name, check the `domain_setup_note`
    output for any manual steps required (e.g. delegating nameservers if
    the hosted zone was newly created outside this stack).
